# MyRunsApp

This is an Android App that allows the user to capture their physical fitness activity (e.g., running, walking, biking, etc.) and view the stats (e.g., path traveled, average speed, current speed, etc.) on Google Maps. It uses sensors (viz. GPS, accelerometers) in the phone to infer the user's activity (e.g., running) in an automatic manner.
