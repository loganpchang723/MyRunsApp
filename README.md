# MyRuns App

This is an Android App that allows the user to capture their physical fitness activity (e.g., running, walking, biking, etc.) and view the stats (e.g., path traveled, average speed, current speed, etc.) on Google Maps. It uses sensors (viz. GPS, accelerometers) in the phone to infer the user's activity (e.g., running) in an automatic manner. The user can view their workout histories (time elapsed, type of workout, path traveled, etc.) and change the relevant settings (distance metrics, profile settings, sign out).

## Technologies Used

Java, Weka Classifier, Google Maps API
